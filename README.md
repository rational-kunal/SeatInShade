## How It Works

The app leverages MapKit to display the map with annotations and the route. It assists with searching for locations and calculating the route and estimated travel time.

### Internally,
1. **Location Search**: Use the location picker to search for the starting and ending locations. This uses MapKit APIs for autocomplete functionality.
2. **Route Calculation**: Using MapKit, calculate the route and the estimated travel time between the selected locations.
3. **Route Segmentation**: Split the route into segments and determine the coordinates of each point.
4. **Sun Direction**: Obtain the sun's direction at each point along the route.

Built with SwiftUI and MapKit, the app also utilizes SwiftAA for astronomical calculations.
